# CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Simple React + Vite + TypeScript starter app for a clinic management UI. Data is stored in localStorage (mock API).

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
```

Notes:
- The app uses localStorage and seeds sample data on first run.
- Tests: `npm test` (vitest)
